# NestlyPDF

**A free, open-source, privacy-first PDF editor that runs locally in your browser.**

🌐 **Try it:** nestlypdf.com

NestlyPDF was built around a simple idea: basic PDF editing shouldn't require uploading your documents to someone else's server or creating an account.

Your PDF stays on your device. Editing and processing happen locally in the browser.

NestlyPDF is also a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, so it can be installed on supported computers, phones, and tablets and used **offline**.

## 🔒 Privacy by Design

NestlyPDF is designed to keep document processing local.

- **No document uploads**
- **No cloud document storage**
- **No account required**
- **PDF processing happens locally in your browser**
- **Word `.docx` files are converted to PDF locally in your browser**
- **Your document stays on your device**

Closing the editor or leaving the session discards the working document from the application. NestlyPDF does not provide cloud document history or synchronization.

> **Note:** Whiteout visually covers content. It should not be considered secure redaction of sensitive information.

## 📚 Large PDF Support

NestlyPDF is designed to remain usable with large documents.

Large PDFs use lazy page and thumbnail rendering rather than attempting to render the entire document at once.

For very large documents, NestlyPDF:

- Detects the document's page count during opening
- Prioritizes the current page
- Virtualizes the page rail
- Renders thumbnails on demand
- Cancels unnecessary offscreen rendering
- Releases rendering resources when they are no longer needed

This helps reduce startup time and memory usage, particularly on lower-powered devices.

---

## 📱 Installable & Offline

NestlyPDF is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**.

On supported browsers, you can install it like a regular application.

Once the application shell has been installed and cached, NestlyPDF can launch and perform its local PDF editing workflow without an internet connection.

This makes it useful on:

- Desktop computers
- Laptops
- Tablets
- Phones

No separate native application is required.

---

## 🖥️ Responsive Design

NestlyPDF is designed to adapt across different screen sizes and available viewport heights.

The interface supports:

- Desktop monitors
- Laptops
- Tablets
- Large and small phones
- Short-height browser windows
- Installed PWA environments

Controls, panels, toolbars, dialogs, and inspector density adapt to the available space while preserving access to editor functionality.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

NestlyPDF is built primarily with:

- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite**
- **PDF.js**
- **pdf-lib**
- **Vitest**
- **React Testing Library**
- **Playwright**
- **Cloudflare Workers / Static Assets**

The application is intentionally browser-local and does not require a document-processing backend.

---

## 🏛️ Architecture

NestlyPDF separates document behavior from presentation and browser/PDF infrastructure.

The project broadly follows:

```text
Domain
   ↓
Application
   ↓
Presentation
   ↓
Infrastructure / PDF adapters
```

The application/domain state is authoritative.

React components should invoke application commands rather than maintaining competing document state.

PDF edits remain represented as editor operations/overlays until export.

---

## 🛡️ Security Principles

The project follows a few important rules:

1. PDF document data stays local to the browser.
2. The original PDF remains unchanged.
3. Editing state exists only for the active local session.
4. Closing a document disposes of its active resources.
5. Document contents should not be written to application logs.
6. Shell/PWA caching must never contain user PDF data.
7. Whiteout is visual covering, **not secure redaction**.

Security and privacy regressions should be treated as release blockers.
