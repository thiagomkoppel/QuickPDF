# Progressive Web App

## Part 1: Installability foundation

QuickPDF can be installed as a standalone browser application on supported Android, iOS/iPadOS, and Chromium desktop browsers. This part provides the manifest, mark-only icons, standalone presentation detection, safe-area layout, and platform-appropriate install guidance.

## Included

- Web app manifest with standalone display, root start URL, root scope, theme/background color, and orientation support.
- Local PNG, maskable, Apple touch, and favicon assets generated from the QuickPDF document/Q mark.
- HTML manifest, theme-color, Apple standalone, touch-icon, and favicon metadata.
- Presentation-only standalone detection via `display-mode: standalone` and iOS `navigator.standalone`.
- Safe-area-aware application shell using `100dvh` and top/bottom safe-area insets.
- An explicit iOS Safari installation action that opens a dismissible Add to Home Screen instruction sheet.
- A deferred Chromium install action through `beforeinstallprompt`, hidden after `appinstalled` or an accepted prompt, and surfaced through a non-intrusive landing onboarding card before installation; its install action appears only when installation is genuinely available.

## Explicitly not included

Part 1 does not register a service worker and does not implement offline support, application-shell caching, background sync, update notifications, autosave, IndexedDB, localStorage, document restoration, or any document cache.

QuickPDF continues to keep active PDFs, overlays, signatures, images, clipboard content, history, and editor state only in browser memory for the active session. Installing the application does not alter this privacy model.

## Routing

The manifest starts at `/` with scope `/`. The existing SPA route behavior remains unchanged:

- `/` opens the landing page.
- `/privacy` remains refreshable through the static host fallback configuration.
- `/editor` without an active in-memory document redirects to the landing page.

## Future parts

Later PWA work must receive a separate privacy review before adding any service worker, cache, offline capability, or update behavior. User document bytes must never enter a service-worker cache.

## Part 2: Offline application shell

Production builds now precache only QuickPDF-owned shell assets. User document bytes and editor sessions remain excluded from Cache Storage and remain memory-only.

## Physical-device offline acceptance

Offline acceptance must use the built production application, never `npm run dev`. Development deliberately does not register the production service worker, so an app installed from a Vite development or plain LAN HTTP origin cannot establish the QuickPDF shell cache required for an offline launch.

Use a production HTTPS deployment or an equivalent locally trusted HTTPS server that exposes the generated `dist/` directory to the device. A plain address such as `http://10.0.0.50:4173` is not a secure context on a separate phone or tablet and is not a valid service-worker/PWA offline test path. `npm run preview` is useful for local desktop checks; its default `127.0.0.1` binding is not reachable from a separate device.

Before installing, verify in the physical browser's remote debugging tools that `navigator.serviceWorker.controller` is non-null, the registration scope is the application's root scope, and the `quickpdf-shell-*` cache contains the shell assets. Then install the app, launch it once online, close it, disable Wi-Fi and mobile data, and launch it from the home screen. Confirm the landing page, local PDF rendering, editing, Original Size export, and Compress PDF export work without network access. Clear the installed app and site data for the exact test origin before retesting a new build.

The static `Starting QuickPDF...` boot surface in `index.html` is visible before the React bundle mounts. It is removed only after a successful React mount, so a cached HTML document with a missing or failing bootstrap asset shows a recovery message rather than a featureless black screen. It does not diagnose PDF compatibility and does not enable caching in development.
