### `03-engineering/UNDO_REDO.md`

Defines user-facing Undo/Redo behavior, shortcuts, toolbar states, supported operations, and interaction expectations.

## Security

### `04-security/PRIVACY_MODEL.md`

Defines the local-only privacy promise and prohibited transmission or persistence of document data.

### `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`

Defines the public policy language for the browser-local implementation, session lifetime, local exports, hosting metadata, and whiteout limitation.

### `04-security/FILE_SECURITY.md`

Defines safe file validation, browser-memory handling, download behavior, and resource cleanup.

### `04-security/THREAT_MODEL.md`

Identifies relevant threats and mitigations for a browser-only PDF editing application.

Defines session creation, dirty-state warnings, replacement, disposal, and unload behavior.

## UI

### `05-ui/ACCESSIBILITY.md`

Defines keyboard, focus, semantic, contrast, status-announcement, and touch-accessibility expectations.

### `05-ui/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`

Defines the visual language of QuickPDF, including colors, typography, spacing, buttons, icons, and motion.

Defines the editor layout, tools, inspector, selection/editing model, zoom, image insertion, overlays, clipboard, and Undo/Redo controls.

### `05-ui/USER_EXPERIENCE.md`

Defines the overall “Open → Edit → Download” journey and principles for keeping workflows fast and understandable.

### `05-ui/RESPONSIVE_DESIGN.md`

Defines desktop, tablet, and mobile behavior, including toolbar adaptation and touch targets.
