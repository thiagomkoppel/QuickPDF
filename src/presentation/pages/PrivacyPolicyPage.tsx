      <p>
        QuickPDF is a browser-based PDF editor. This policy explains how the application handles
        information while you open, edit, and export a PDF. Our design is intentionally local:
        document processing happens in your browser rather than on a QuickPDF application server.

      <p>
        Your PDF, rendered pages, overlay elements, text, images, signatures, initials, and other
        editing state are processed in your browser memory for the active session. QuickPDF does not
        upload PDF contents to a QuickPDF server or store document contents in a QuickPDF database.

      <p>
        QuickPDF does not require an account and does not intentionally collect your document
        contents, extracted text, signatures, editing data, or exported files. QuickPDF does not
        place document contents in URLs, browser history, analytics, or error reporting.

      <p>
        The active PDF and editing state are session-only. They may be lost after a page refresh,
        tab closure, browser closure, navigating away, or browser memory cleanup. QuickPDF does not
        use LocalStorage, IndexedDB, cookies, or a document-history feature to restore your active
        document.

        Drawn, typed, and uploaded signatures and initials can contain sensitive information. They
        are handled in the same browser-memory session as the document and are not sent to a
        QuickPDF server. You are responsible for deciding whether your device and browser are
        appropriate for the documents you edit.

        When you download an edited PDF, QuickPDF creates the export in your browser and downloads
        it directly to your device. The downloaded file is then handled by your browser and device
        according to their normal download settings.

        QuickPDF may be delivered through a third-party static hosting provider. That provider can
        process ordinary request metadata, such as an IP address, browser information, and request
        time, under its own policies. This technical hosting data is separate from your PDF
        contents, which QuickPDF processes locally in your browser.

        own policies; review those policies when you visit those services.

      <p>
        Browser-local processing reduces the need to transfer document contents to an application
        server, but it cannot make every environment risk-free. Device security, browser extensions,
        shared computers, malware, and your browser configuration can affect privacy and security.
        Use QuickPDF only on devices and browsers you trust.

        QuickPDF whiteout is a visual overlay used to cover content in the exported PDF. It is not

        the original document.

        QuickPDF can be used from different locations because document processing occurs on your
